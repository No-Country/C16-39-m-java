# Movie Pulse web application 🎬

## Acerca del proyecto 📝

`Movie-Pulse` is a site where users can share their reviews, comment, rate and 
share their love for both classic and current films. In this app we can create 
a movie-loving community that allows everyone to discover new works of the seventh art.

Our team has developed a full-stack application that allows users to create an account,
log in, and share their opinions about movies.
